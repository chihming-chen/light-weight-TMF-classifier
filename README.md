## Trial Master Files (TMFs)
Trial Master Files (TMFs) are a crucial aspect of clinical trials, serving as the official repository for all the documents that allow for the conduct of the trial, as well as the recording of the intentions, processes, and outcomes. These files are essential for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and good clinical practice (GCP) standards. The main purpose of a TMF is to provide a comprehensive documentation system that enables the conduct of a clinical trial to be fully reconstructed and audited.

## Formats
**Paper TMFs**: Traditionally, TMFs were kept in paper format, organized in binders or files, which could be cumbersome and space-consuming.
**Electronic TMFs (eTMFs)**: With advances in Electronic Document Management Systems (EDMS), electronic TMFs have become more common, offering advantages in terms of accessibility, searchability, and storage efficiency. eTMFs must comply with regulatory standards for electronic records.

## TMF Reference Model
The CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium) TMF Reference Model is a standardized framework for organizing and managing the documents and content that comprise a TMF in clinical trials. This model serves as an industry best practice and provides a comprehensive structure to ensure that TMF documentation is complete, well-organized, and compliant with regulatory expectations.

The model defines a comprehensive set of document types and categories
